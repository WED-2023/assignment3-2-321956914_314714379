The following changes were made in the API from the moment we started to develop the project : 

1. no need for confirm password in register request, since validations only happen in client side.

2. add logout api call

3. No authentication token is needed in the project, so we removed it - login doesn't return one and operations do not require one, instead we use session cookies.

4. lastsearch now returns the results of the search and not the query.

5. update api responses that are returning preview of recipes to return the correct data.

6. change a few endpoints name - no special reason ( for example removing me from paths on users operations )

7. move post favorite to /users, feels more natural after diving deeper into the project.

8. no need to pass isliked, isviewed to the backend when creating a recipe, it will be provisioned by the server based on the other tables in the database.

9. removed use of wrong schemas.

10. add api for getting recipe information from local db.

11. add family recipes end point for user.
